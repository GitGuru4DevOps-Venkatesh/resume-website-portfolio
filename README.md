**How to use this as website using Docker in AWS-Instance**
**Follow the below steps**

The image you sent shows a screenshot of a GitHub repository called `responsive-portfolio`. The repository contains the following files:

* assets/
* README.md
* index.html
* preview.png

To deploy these files using Docker, you will need to create a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. The following is a simple Dockerfile for deploying a static website:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest

COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

This Dockerfile copies all of the files from the current directory into the `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory in the Docker image. It then exposes port 80, which is the port that Nginx uses to serve web pages. Finally, it sets the command for the container to `nginx -g daemon off;`. This command tells Nginx to run in the foreground mode so that it does not exit when the container stops.

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```
docker build -t responsive-portfolio .
```

This will build a Docker image with the tag `responsive-portfolio`.

To deploy the Docker image, run the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 responsive-portfolio
```

This will start a Docker container running the Nginx image. The `-d` flag tells Docker to run the container in the background mode. The `-p 80:80` flag maps port 80 on the host machine to port 80 in the Docker container.

Once the container is running, you can access the website at `http://localhost:80`.

You can also use Docker Compose to deploy your application. Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multiple Docker containers in a single configuration file. The following is a simple Docker Compose file for deploying the `responsive-portfolio` application:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  web:
    build: .
    image: responsive-portfolio
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

This Docker Compose file defines a single service called `web`. The `build` directive tells Docker Compose to build the Docker image from the current directory. The `image` directive tells Docker Compose to use the `responsive-portfolio` Docker image. The `ports` directive maps port 80 on the host machine to port 80 in the Docker container.

To deploy the application using Docker Compose, run the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the Docker Compose stack and deploy the `web` service.

Once the stack is running, you can access the website at `http://localhost:80`.

Which method you choose to deploy your application will depend on your specific needs. If you are only deploying a single container, then you can use the `docker run` command. If you are deploying multiple containers, or if you want to use a more advanced deployment configuration, then you can use Docker Compose.

------------------------------------------------------------------End of the above project steps--------------------------------------------------------

Let's go through the process assuming you want to set up and deploy this project on a server using Docker and Kubernetes. Keep in mind that the provided steps are generic, and you may need to adapt them based on the specific requirements and structure of the repository.

Certainly, let's break it down into clear steps for setting up Docker and Kubernetes on an AWS Ubuntu server:

### 1. **AWS Setup:**

   - Launch an EC2 instance with Ubuntu.
   - Configure security groups to allow SSH (port 22) and any other ports your application needs.

### 2. **Connect to your Instance:**

   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-instance-ip
   ```

### 3. **Install Docker:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

### 4. **Install Kubernetes:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl
   curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   echo "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm kubelet kubectl
   ```

### 5. **Initialize Kubernetes Cluster:**

   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
   ```

   Follow the instructions provided by the `kubeadm init` command.

### 6. **Set Up kubectl for Your User:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
   sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
   sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
   ```

### 7. **Install Pod Network (Calico):**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.18/manifests/calico.yaml
   ```

### 8. **(Optional) Join Worker Nodes:**

   If you have additional nodes, use the `kubeadm join` command provided after the `kubeadm init` on the master node.

### 9. **Deploy Your Application:**

   Create and apply Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for your application.Wait for the external IP to be assigned:

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc -o wide
   ```

   Access your application using the external IP.

### 11. **Additional Considerations:**

### Prerequisites:

1. Ensure you have Docker and Kubernetes installed on your server (follow the steps mentioned in the previous responses).
2. Make sure your AWS instance is running and accessible.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GitGuru4DevOps-Venkatesh/resume-website-portfolio.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project:**

    ```bash
    cd resume-website-portfolio
    ```

3. **Build and Run the Docker Container Locally (Optional):**

    - Review the Dockerfile in the project to understand the build process.
    - Build the Docker image:

        ```bash
        docker build -t resume-website .
        ```

    - Run the Docker container locally:

        ```bash
        docker run -p 8080:80 resume-website
        ```

    Access the website locally at http://localhost:8080.

4. **Prepare Kubernetes Manifests:**

    - Create Kubernetes manifests for your application. This involves defining Deployments, Services, and possibly ConfigMaps or Secrets.
    - Here's a basic example:

        ```yaml
        # deployment.yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: resume-website
        spec:
          replicas: 1
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: resume-website
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: resume-website
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: resume-website
                  image: your-docker-username/resume-website:latest
                  ports:
                    - containerPort: 80
        ```

        ```yaml
        # service.yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: resume-website
        spec:
          selector:
            app: resume-website
          ports:
            - protocol: TCP
              port: 80
              targetPort: 80
          type: LoadBalancer
        ```

5. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**

    Apply the Kubernetes manifests:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
    ```

6. **Access the Website:**

    Get the external IP of the service:

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc resume-website
    ```

    Access the website using the external IP.

7. **Additional Considerations:**

    - Configure any environment-specific settings (e.g., database connection strings) either through ConfigMaps or environment variables.
    - Implement persistent storage if needed.

Remember, these are general steps, and your project structure might require additional configurations or modifications. Review the documentation and source code of the project for any specific setup instructions or dependencies. If you encounter any issues or have specific questions about the project, feel free to ask!
